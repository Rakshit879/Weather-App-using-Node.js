🌦️ Weather App using Node.js
I have developed a weather web app that allows users to get the current weather conditions of any location. This app is built using the following tech stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate my Node.js skills.

In this project, we have created our own server using Node.js, and various features are accessible through different endpoints.

🚀 How to Run the App:
1. Clone or download the code into your code editor.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder (where index.js is located).
3. Start the server by running the command:

node index.js

4. Open your browser and go to:

http://localhost:3000/
Your application will be up and running there.

🔑 Getting the API Key:
To fetch weather data, you’ll need an API key. You can get it from the following website:
